# Single Page Idea

Simple tool for sharing ideas expressed linearly in a single page of formatted text. Pretty much a gist.

Create github-pages branch. Edit the README.md file. Now you've got an username.github.io/reponame endpoint to share your formatted text with folks without the other clutter of the rest of the Github web interface.
